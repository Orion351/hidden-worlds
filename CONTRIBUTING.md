# Contributing
This outlines all the norms we're doing to make collaboration go smoothly. Please be gentle with one naother. <3

# Branching
When you want to develop a feature, make a branch off of main. If you want to branch off of an in-development branch, talk to me first.

# Checking out directories
The free tier of Github does not support checking out directories in the interface. Check [FIXME] for who's got what checked out right now.

The directories that can be checked out are usually at least 3 levels deep from the root directory. So:
..\graphics\entities\[bespoke assembler, your checked out directory]

If there is another category layer, go one more deep. So:
..\graphics\entities\wood-minisemblers\[bespoke assembler, your checked out directory]

You'll likely have more than one directory checked out at a time, like the entity, icon, script, etc. for it.

Talk to me to set up a directory for you to check out.
